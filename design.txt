    In the beginning, I decided to try and do this entire project using
procedural decomposition since it felt more comfortable to me considering
that we have been doing it for most of the semester. However, in
the middle, I began having to use global variables so I made my game functions
into methods of the MasterMindGame class. I also made the turtle board boxes
into its own file called TurtleBoxes to maintain readability and to separate
the background from the main game functions. Much like the Marble class,
I put the Arrow class into its own file as well because it seemed easier
to design and control its movements by creating its own class. 

    Given that I had more time, I would have liked to refactor my code in
order to make it the most efficient as possible. I realized while testing
and running my game that the actions may feel slow at times and this is
something I would like to improve moving on in the future.
